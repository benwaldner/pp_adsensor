Adsensor was the first project I built after leaving Pangea. It is an anti-fraud tool used in DSP ad creatives to determine the nature of the impression and user delivering said impression. 

This tool helped boost our media buying efforts and resulted in massive revenues that helped fund my partner and I's e-commerce business. I built this tool from scratch.

This tool was built with my familiar front-end and back-end stacks. This project gave me a deep understanding of the advertising value chain and ecosystem as well as ad fraud techniques. I am proud of this project as it helped enable so much.

Live app and servers no longer maintained.
